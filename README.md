### Hi there welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

My name is Heriberto Roman. I am a self-taught developer with six years of
engineering experience and four years of experience as a technical instructor.
I worked for startups in the techEd, higherEd, and the non-profit sector. 
As a Technical Instructor, I leveraged computational thinking and problem-solving skills to create a new
pedagogy {D.A.B} and MVP web app called cThink, which helps code newbies learn
core programming concepts through analogies.

As a Software Engineer with a strong design background, I take a holistic
approach in the consideration of every new project. I believe that great
design is a result of the collaboration between designers, developers and
stakeholders, whose combined experience and efforts come together to create
great user experiences.

I believe that great user experiences are created through understanding not
only user expectations and goals, but also the commitment to help see through
expectations and goals through effective storytelling and enhanced
functionality. As a developer and designer, I aspire to be apart of a team
that is oriented in this way and look forward to applying my knowledge and
skill toward the concept and creation of sophisticated digital products.

I am passionate about learning from others and always interested in advancing
my software architecture skills and cloud computing strategies. I'd love for
my next role to be at a company that values mentorship and diversity.
